Rehab,Amy Winehouse,"[Produced by Mark Ronson]

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 2]
The man said ""Why do you think you here?""
I said, ""I got no idea""
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, ""I just think you're depressed""
This, me: ""Yeah, baby, and the rest""

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

[Verse 3]
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go"
You Know Iâ€™m No Good,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled-up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinkin' on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet ya, chips and pita
You say, ""When we married"", 'cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no good"
Me & Mr. Jones,Amy Winehouse,"[Intro]
Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

[Chorus]
What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (Oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (When I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that

[Verse 1]
No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (All them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (To yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (Out) like this

[Bridge]
Rulers one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

[Chorus]
What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (Dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (Make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?
What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew (Best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through (We were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do

[Outro]
Mr. Destiny, 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Mr. Jones (Me and Mr. Jones)
Me and, oh"
Just Friends,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
When will we get the time to be just friends?
It's never safe for us, not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning where your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
""Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?""

[Chorus]
When will we get the time to be just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends?

[Verse 2]
And, no, I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Though we need to find the time to just do this shit together
For it gets worse
I wanna touch you, but that just hurts

[Chorus]
When will we get the time to be just, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?

[Outro]
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
Just friends?"
Back to Black,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us

[Verse 2]
I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life
Is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

[Bridge]
Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black"
Love Is a Losing Game,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five-story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wished I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

[Verse 2]
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

[Verse 3]
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game"
Tears Dry on Their Own,Amy Winehouse,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Bridge]
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah

[Outro]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry"
Wake Up Alone,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough, so I don't have to wonder, ""Where is he?""
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself, I do a 180
I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

[Chorus]
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

[Verse 2]
As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless
Second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest, 'cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold, I stand before him (Before him)
It's all I can do to assure him (Assure him)
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight
Drowning me, we bathe under blue light (Under blue)

[Chorus]
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

[Outro]
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone"
Some Unholy War,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
If my man was fightin' some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him with strength
He didn't know, it's you I'm fightin' for
He can't lose with me in tow (With me in tow)
I refuse to let him go (To let him go)
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

[Verse 2]
We put it in writin', but who you writin' for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, recitin', my stomach standin' still
Like you're readin' my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say (Scars say)
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale (Bitter finale)
Just me, my dignity
And this guitar case, woah, woah

[Outro]
Yes, yes, my man's fightin' some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dyin' for?
B, I would have died, too, I'd  like to
If my man was fightin' some unholy war
Yeah, if my man was fightin'"
He Can Only Hold Her,Amy Winehouse,"[Intro]
Woah, ooh
Oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh

[Verse 1]
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks, ""What's she running from?""

[Chorus]
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies

[Verse 2]
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

[Chorus]
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies

[Outro]
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her, it never dies
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies"
Addicted,Amy Winehouse,"[Verse 1]
Tell your boyfriend, next time he around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if brave would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you then leave him my dro

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed, man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours

[Verse 2]
Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door, make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed, man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours

[Verse 3]
I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man but I gots to burn?
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my home grown
Oh, it's got me addicted
Does more than any dick did

[Outro]
Yeah, I can get mine
And you get yours
Hey, I can get mine
And you get yours"
