## Data Summary
	Our goal is to write an algorithm that takes an input string of lyrics and outputs the artist and song that those lyrics belong to, with a certain probability 
	score that those lyrics belong to that artist. We used the PyCharm package lyricsgenius and its API function to collect the lyrics. To accomplish this goal, we 
	collected 3 albums' worth of lyrics from 3 different artists. The artists we chose were Amy Winehouse, Taylor Swift, and Sabrina Carpenter. 

Provenance
	The data for this project was pulled from Spotify using lyricsgenius and the API function Spotipy. The lyrics and album names are the same as the original 
	creation from the artist. We have not changed any of the spelling or wording used, and all information is reflected as it can be found on Spotify. 

License
	The data used for this project is not our own and belongs entirely to the artist or owner. The lyrics, album, and artist have not been altered after 
	downloading from Spotify.
