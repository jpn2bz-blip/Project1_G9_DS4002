Manchild,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Intro]
Oh boy

[Verse 1]
You said your phone was broken, just forgot to charge it
Whole outfit you're wearing, God, I hope it's ironic
Did you just say you're finished? Didn't know we started
It's all just so familiar, baby, what do you call it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Stupid
Or is it slow?
Maybe it's useless?
But there's a cuter word for it, I know

[Chorus]
Man-child
Why you always come a-running to me?
Fuck my life
Won't you let an innocent woman be?
Never heard of self-care
Half your brain just ain't there
Man-child
Why you always come a-running, taking all my loving from me?

[Verse 2]
Why so sexy if so dumb?
And how survive the Earth so long?
If I'm not there, it won't get done
I choose to blame your mom

[Chorus]
Man-child
Why you always come a-running to me?
Fuck my life
Won't you let an innocent woman be?
Never heard of self-care
Half your brain just ain't there
Man-child
Why you always come a-running, taking all my loving from me?

[Bridge]
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get
And I like my men all incompetent
And I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them
Amen, hey, men
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get (Play hard to get)
And I like my men all incompetent (Incompetent)
And I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them (Not choosing them)
Amen (Amen), hey, men (Hey, men)

[Chorus]
Man-child
Why you always come a-running to me? (Always come a-running to me)
Fuck my life
Won't you let an innocent woman be? (Amen)

[Outro]
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get (Play hard to get)
And I like my men all incompetent (Incompetent)
And I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them (Not choosing them)
Amen (Amen), hey, men (Hey, men)"
Tears,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Intro]
Mm
Mm-hmm
Uh (Shikitah)

[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs

[Verse 1]
A little initiative can go a very long, long way
Baby, just do the dishes, I'll give you what you (What you), what you want
A little communication, yes, that's my ideal foreplay
Assemble a chair from IKEA, I'm like, ""Uh"" (Ah)

[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (So responsible)
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs

[Verse 2]
A little respect for women can get you very, very far
Remembering how to use your phone gets me oh so, oh so, oh so hot
Considering I have feelings, I'm like, ""Why are my clothes still on?"" (Mm)
Offering to do anything, I'm like, ""Oh my God""

[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (So responsible)
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs

[Post-Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (I get)
Being a responsible guy (Responsible guy)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Supposed to do)
Tears run down my thighs (Dance break)

[Bridge]
No
So responsible
No

[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (Guy, so responsible)
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs (Shikitah)"
My Man on Willpower,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
He's clingy, he's loving, he always initiates
Callin' and touchin', it feels like just yesterday
He wanted all four of my personalities
Now I don't recognize this

[Pre-Chorus]
Stranger (Stranger) danger (Danger)
There in my bed at night
Wide-eyed (Dreamin'), ponderin' (Schemin')
What life without me'd be like
Can I return it, get back the version I like?
This one's bullshit, baby

[Chorus]
My man on his willpower is something I don't understand
He fell in love with self-restraint and now it's gettin' out of hand
He used to be literally obsessed with me
I'm suddenly the least sought after girl in the land
Oh, my man on his willpower
Is something I don't under, something I don't understand

[Verse 2]
He's busy, he's workin', he doesn't have time for me
My slutty pajamas not temptin' him in the least
What in the fucked up romantic dark comedy
Is this nightmare lately?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, okay, okay, he's on his big journey to find
A little zest of life, a new sense of purpose, but why?
I'm right here (Right here), I'm waving (Hello)
The joke can be over now
You're so silly, baby

[Chorus]
My man on his willpower is something I don't understand
He fell in love with self-restraint and now it's gettin' out of hand
He used to be literally obsessed with me
I'm suddenly the least sought after girl in the land
Oh, my man on his willpower
Is something I don't under, something I don't understand

[Bridge]
No, oh
My man's in touch with his emotions
My man won't touch me with a twenty-foot pole
My man's forgotten his devotion
Where he's gone, God only knows

[Outro]
Where he's gone, God only knows"
Sugar Talking,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Put your loving where your mouth is
Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh
Put your loving where your mouth is
Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me
Get your sorry ass to mine

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Saying that you miss me
Boy, do you win a prize?
You're havin' these epiphanies
Big word for a real small mind
And aren't you tired of saying a whole lot of nothing?

[Refrain]
You tell me that you want me (Want me)
But baby, if you need me (Need me)

[Chorus]
Put your loving where your mouth is
Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh
Say you're a big changed man, I doubt it
Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me
Get your sorry ass to mine

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
You filled my whole apartment with flowers that die
The first to open up your wallet
But the last one to flag, a heart only breaks so many times
Save your money and stop makin' me cry

[Refrain]
You tell me that you want me (Oh, I know what you want)
(Want me)
But baby, if you need me (Need me), yeah

[Bridge]
Oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Put your loving where your mouth is
Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh
Put your loving where your mouth is
Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me
It's verbatim what you said last week
It's your seventh last chance, honey
Get your sorry ass to mine"
We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
""Bullshit repeats itself,"" is that how the saying goes?
Been here a thousand times, selective memory though
I hear it in his eyes, he sees it in my tone
Is what it is and it's predictable

[Chorus]
All the ""I love you""s and ""I'm sorry""s were said
We had our sex and then we made amends, that's right
Called it a false alarm to all of our friends
Then we almost broke up again last night

[Post-Chorus]
We almost
Got so close

[Verse 2]
When I reach to pull the plug
I swear he starts working out
And on the days I'm a little much
That's when I tell him how sweet he treats me
And how no other boys compete
I know how it looks, I know how it sounds
Least we'll give 'em something to talk about

[Chorus]
All the ""I love you""s and ""I'm sorry""s were said (Sorry's were said)
We had our sex and then we made amends, that's right
Called it a false alarm to all of our friends
Then we almost broke up again last night

[Bridge]
You say we're driftin' apart
I said, ""Yeah, I fucking know""
Big deal, we've been here before
And we'll be here tomorrow
Oh

[Chorus]
All the ""I love you""s and ""I'm sorry""s were said
We had our sex and then we made amends, that's right
Called it a false alarm to all of our friends
Then we almost broke up again, oh

[Outro]
We almost broke up, we almost broke up again
We almost broke up, we almost broke up again
Gave me his whole heart, then I gave him head and then
We almost broke up, we almost broke up
Yeah, we almost broke up again"
Nobody’s Son,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
""Hi, I hope you're great
I think it's time we took a break
So I can grow emotionally""
That's what he said to me

[Chorus]
Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love, and I'm the one they call for a third wheeling
Probably should have guessed, he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in

[Verse 2]
Me? No, yeah, I'm good
Just thought that he eventually would cave in, rеach out
But no siree, he discovered sеlf-control (He discovered it this week)
This week (Oh, ah)

[Chorus]
Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love, and I'm the one they call for a third wheeling
Probably should have guessed, he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in

[Post-Chorus]
Believe in, no
Woah, woah

[Bridge]
That boy is corrupt (Ah)
Could you raise him to love me, maybe?
He sure fucked me up (Ah-ah)
And yes, I'm talking 'bout your baby
That boy is corrupt (Ah)
Get PTSD on the daily
He sure fucked me up (Ah-ah)
And yes, I'm talking 'bout your baby (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love, and I'm the one they call for a third wheeling
Probably should have guessed, he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in"
Never Getting Laid,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
We were so happy, why not mix it up?
I'm so at peace, yeah, I can't drink enough
No way to know just who you're thinkin' of
I just wish you didn't have a mind (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That could flip like a switch
That could wander and drift
To a neighboring bitch
When just the other night
You said you need me, what gives?
How did it come to this?
Boy, I know where you live

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not angry
Love you just the same
I just hope you get agoraphobia some day
And all your days are sunny
From your windowpane
Wish you a lifetime full of happiness
And a forever of never getting laid

[Verse 2]
I think this schedule could be very nice (Very nice)
Call up the boys and crack a Miller Lite, watch the fight
Us girls are fun, but stressful, am I right? (Am I right?)
And you got a right hand anyway (And only yesterday)

[Pre-Chorus]
Was when we called it quits (Called it quits)
I was so confident (Confident)
'Til the thought of it hit
That any given night
You could be using your lips
On a girl with big tits
Boy, I know where you live

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not angry
I love you just the same
I just hope you get agoraphobia some day
And all your days are sunny (Sunny from your windowpane)
From your windowpane
I wish you a lifetime full of happiness
And a forever of never getting laid (Forever, mm)
A forever of never getting laid (Mm, hmm)

[Outro]
At the end of the rainbow
I hope you find
A good whole lot of nothing
'Cause you're still inside
And abstinence is just a state of mind"
When Did You Get Hot?,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
So long, untouched
Bone-dry, not a plant can grow
'Bout time I get
Back on the horse to the rodeo

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm at the prospect convention
My friends walk in your friends' direction
Said, ""Sabrina, don't you know Devin?""
And I was like, ""Huh""

[Chorus]
When did you get hot?
All the sudden, I could look you up and down all day (Hey)
When did you get hot?
I think I would remember if you had that face (That face)
I did a double take, triple take
Take me to naked Twister back at your place
Baby, baby, mm, it's thickening the plot
When did you get hot?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh

[Verse 2]
Congratulations on your new improvements
I bet your light rod's, like, bigger than Zeus's
Hey, wait, can you lift my car with your hand?
You were an ugly kid, but you're a sexy man

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry, I did not see the vision (Did not see the vision)
Thank the Lord, the fine you has risen (The fine you has risen)
Big riff coming, I need a minute
Wait, I need a minute
Okay, here it comes
Oh

When did you get hot?
All the sudden, I could look you up and down all day (All day)
When did you get hot?
I think I would remember if you had that face (That face)
I did a double take, triple take (Damn)
Take me to naked Twister back at your place
Baby, baby, mm, it's thickening the plot
When did you get hot?

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh (What?)
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Outro]
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get so hot? (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get so hot?
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get so hot? (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get—"
Go Go Juice,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
Love when happy hour comes at 10 a.m. o'clock on a Tuesday
Guess a broken heart doesn't care that I just woke up
Got a soft spot for a bev and a boy that's fruity
Can't lie, whole week's been tough

[Pre-Chorus]
No party invitations, not goin' to the club

[Chorus]
I'm just drinking to call someone
Ain't nobody's safe when I'm a little bit drunk
Could be John or Larry, gosh, who's to say?
Or the one that rhymes with ""villain"" if I'm feelin' that way
Oh, I'm just drinking to call someone
A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped
Sippin' on my go-go juice, I can't be blamed
Some good old-fashioned fun sure numbs the pain

[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring, yeah, it's super important
(How many shots in an ounce?)
I might have double vision, but that is irrelevant right now
(Answer me, baby, um, are you in town?)
I miss you and I think about you every minute
If you're still disinterested in me, well, fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Just tryin' different numbers, didn't think that you'd pick up

[Chorus]
I'm just drinking to call someone
Ain't nobody's safe when I'm a little bit drunk
Could be John or Larry, gosh, who's to say?
Or the one that rhymes with ""villain"" if I'm feelin' that way
Oh, I'm just drinking to call someone
A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped
Sippin' on my go-go juice, I can't be blamed
Some good old-fashioned fun sure numbs the pain

[Bridge]
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da, da-da-da
How's yous been? What's up?
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Bye, it's me, how's mm-call, do you me still love?
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da, da-da-da
Should we hooks up?
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Bye, it's me, how's mm-call, do you me still love?

[Chorus]
I'm just drinking to call someone
Ain't nobody's safe when I'm a little bit drunk
Could be John or Larry, gosh, who's to say?
Or the one that rhymes with ""villain"" if I'm feelin' that way
Oh, I'm just drinking to call someone
A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped (Girl who's been dumped)
Sippin' on my go-go juice, I can't be blamed (Oh-oh)
Some good old-fashioned fun sure numbs the pain"
Don’t Worry I’ll Make You Worry,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
You think that I'm gonna fuck with your head
Well, you're absolutely right
Your perfect timing couldn't be worse
Actually, it's impressive how you don't read signs

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll never call you right back
But when I do, I'm making you laugh
Then I'll bitch you out when I please
(I still think you love me)

[Chorus]
So don't worry
I'll make you worry like no other girl can
So don't worry
Damn sure I'll never let you know where you stand

[Post-Chorus]
Ah (Ah, ah)
Ah, ah (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Silent treatment and humblin' your ass
Well, that's some of my best work (Ah)
Thought sleeping with you might help me decide
But it was annoyingly good, so thanks for making it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
But on the forty-minute drive home (Wow)
You're internalizing my jokes (Mm)
And your mother even agrees (Ah)
That emotional lottery is all you'll ever get with me

[Chorus]
So don't worry
I'll make you worry like no other girl can
So don't worry
Damn sure I'll never let you know where you stand

[Bridge]
Ah (Ah, ah)
Ah, ah (Ah)
Ah (Ah, ah)
Ah, ah (Ah)
(Hope you're feeling lucky)

[Chorus]
So don't worry
I'll make you worry like no other girl can
So don't worry
I'll leave you feeling like a shell of a man

Ah, ah
(Don't worry)
(Don't worry, babe)
(Don't worry)
Ah, ah (Don't worry)"
House Tour,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Intro]
Take your shoes off

[Verse 1]
Thank you for dinner, baby, I had a really great time
I really loved the conversation and that your car self-drives
The pineapple air freshener is my favorite kind
Well, this is me, but if you have time

[Chorus]
Do you want the house tour?
I could take you to the first, second, third floor
And I promise none of this is a metaphor
I just want you to come inside
Baby, what's mine is now yours

[Verse 2]
The couch is really comfy, comfy
Got some Chips Ahoy if you’re hungry, hungry (Oh)
You don't need to love me, love me, lovе me
I'm just so proud of my design (To dim the lights)

[Chorus]
Do you want thе house tour?
I could take you to the first, second, third floor (I could take you to the—)
And I promise none of this is a metaphor (And I promise none of—, ah)
I just want you to come inside (Come inside)
But never enter through the back door
House tour
Yeah, I spent a little fortune on the waxed floors
We can be a little reckless ’cause it's insured
I'm pleasured to be your hot tour guide
Baby, what's mine is now yours (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Co-come on, babe, oh
Oh baby, if you come inside, if you come inside
I might let you, uh

My house is on Pretty Girl Avenue
My house was especially built for you
Some say it's a place where your dreams come true
My house could be your house too

Oh (House tour)
So, um (To the first, second, third floor)
(House tour)
(And I promise this is not a metaphor)
Are you coming in or what?"
Goodbye,Sabrina Carpenter,"[Verse 1]
Broke my heart on Saturday
Guess overnight, your feelings changed
And I have cried so much, I almost fainted (Aha, aha)
To show you just how much it hurts
I wish I had a gun or words
If something got lost in communication (Aha, aha)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, sayonara, adiós
You're not bilingual, but you should know

[Chorus]
Goodbye means that you’re losing me for life
Can't call it love, then call it quits
Can't shoot me down, then shoot the shit
Did you forget that it was you who said goodbye?
So you don’t get to be the one who cries
Can't have your cake and eat it too
By walking out, that means you choose goodbye

[Verse 2]
The feeling's so specific
Wanna punch you every other minute, oh
You used to love my ass, now, baby, you won't see it anymorе (Aha, aha)
Well, just give it three weeks, buddy
Gonna wake up from your coma, honеy, oh
And that's when you'll be holding hokey flowers, standing at my door (Aha)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll say, ""Arrivederci, au revoir""
Forgive my French, but fuck you, ta-ta

[Chorus]
Goodbye means that you're losing me for life
Can’t call it love, then call it quits
Can’t shoot me down, then shoot the shit
Did you forget that it was you who said goodbye?
(It was you who said goodbye)
So you don't get to be the one who cries
Can’t have your cake and eat it too
By walking out, that means you choose goodbye

[Bridge]
Sayonara, adiós
On the flip side, cheerio
Por siempre te amo, wait, no
Shit, when did you get here?
Go put on some clothes

[Chorus]
Goodbye means that you're losing me for life
Can't call it love, then call it quits (Can't call it quits)
Can’t shoot me down, then shoot the shit
Did you forget that it was you who said goodbye?
(It was you who said goodbye)
So you don't get to be the one who cries
Can't have your cake and eat it too
By walking out, that means you choose goodbye
Goodbye

Get home safe"
