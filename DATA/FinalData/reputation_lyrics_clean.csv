...Ready for It?,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go (Go)
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low (Low)
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby, mmm (Mmm)
In the middle of the night (The night) in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it? Oh
Are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin, ah-ah
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin

End Game,Taylor Swift,"[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game

I wanna be your A-Team (
Woah, woah
)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (
Yeah
)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You don’t wanna see)
I don’t wanna miss you (
I don't wanna miss you
)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on the beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumours, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, somethin' was born on the 4th of July
Our past days were the fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you (
I don't wanna be
)
Just another ex-love (
You don't wanna see
)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on the beach with (
You all over me

I know what they all say (Yeah)
But I ain't tryna play (Ooh)

Hey

Big reputation, big reputation
 (Big reputation, yeah)
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been callin' my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips (Ooh, ah)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future & Ed Sheeran]

I Did Something Bad,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh, so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothin'
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did somethin' bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did somethin' bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Post-Chorus]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da, da, da

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did somethin' bad (
Da-da
)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did somethin' bad
But why's it feel so good?

And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one

Somethin' happened for the first time

Delicate,Taylor Swift,"[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

[Pre-Chorus]

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best

Sometimes, I wonder, when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all the damn time

Look What You Made Me Do,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I (I) don't (Don't) like your kingdom keys (Keys)
They (They) once belonged to me (Me)
You (You) asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

So It Goes...,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Gettin' caught up in a moment, lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep and I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I do bad things with you
So it goes

[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know

So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now

Gorgeous,Taylor Swift,"[Intro: James Reynolds]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (

At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)

There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)

Getaway Car,Taylor Swift,"[Intro]
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn’t mean it and you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh)

[Chorus]
You were drivin’ the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

[Post-Chorus]
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren’t thinkin’ and I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin’ after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story and now we’re both sorry (We're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me

Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)

We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win

[Breakdown]
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car

Don't pretend it's such a mystery

King of My Heart,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me ""baby"" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waitin' for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah

Woah, woah

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat

Dancing with Our Hands Tied,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason

Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I

[Pre-Chorus]
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feelin'

[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'

[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'

[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin' (Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'

[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again, yeah)

[Chorus]
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin' (Oh, yeah, we were dancin')
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancin' (Oh)
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied (Dancin' with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin' (Had a bad feelin')
But we were dancin'

[Outro]
Hands tied, hands tied
(Dancin')","I, I loved you in secret First sight, yeah, we love without reason Oh, twenty-five years old Oh, how were you to know? And My, my love had been frozen Deep blue, but you painted me golden Oh, and you held me close Oh, how was I to know? I I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets Picture of your face in an invisible locket You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it I had a bad feelin' And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces I knew there was no one in the world who could take it I had a bad feelin' But we were dancin' Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied Yeah, we were dancin' Like it was the first time, first time Yeah, we were dancin' Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied Yeah, we were dancin' And I had a bad feelin' But we were dancin' I, I loved you in spite of Deep fears that the world would divide us So, baby, can we dance Oh, through an avalanche?
